= To Do Application
This is my learning application. I'm building a simple app with React, Go and MongoDB.
There is a `docker-compose.yaml` file that sets up a local dev server.

== MongoDB
The database is Mongo. Create a local user that has `readWrite` access.

[source,json]
----
{
    user: 'test',
    pwd: passwordPrompt(),
    roles: [
        {
            role: 'readWrite',
            db: 'test'
        }
    ]
}
----

== Go Server
The Go mid-tier needs to create a connection string in order to connect to the Mongo database.
Set the appropriate environment variables on the mid-tier container.

[source]
----
MONGO_HOST=db
MONGO_USER=todo
MONGO_PASSWORD=xxxxxxxxx
MONGO_DATABASE=test
